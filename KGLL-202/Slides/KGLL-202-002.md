There are a number of key components to the Kong Gateway infrastructure
 - **Kong Gateway** - Brokers API requests across all upstream services
 - **Kong Manager** - Browser-based UI for monitoring and managing Kong Gateway
 - **Kong Developer Portal** - Build a service catalog to simplify discovery & re-use of APIs

These are logical components and part of the same binary.  Additionally in most installations a database is also required

## Kong Gateway Container Images 

Kong Gateway provides slim and UBI images:
 - Universal Base Image (UBI) - OCI-compliant container base operating system images with complementary runtime languages and packages that are freely redistributable
 - Slim Images - only contain software required to run the Gateway.
   - This ensures that false positive vulnerabilities aren't flagged during security scanning
   - Any vulnerabilities detected in supported images will be addressed in the next available patch release.

**If you require other dependencies, you can build custom Kong Docker images - see docs for details

# Start the Kong containers

We are now ready to start the containers to deploy Kong.

We will perform the following specific tasks:
1. Bring up Kong Gateway
2. Verify Admin API
3. Verify Kong Manager

## Task 1: Bring up Kong Gateway

Make sure you're in the `installation` directory and run `docker-compose up -d`.

```shell
docker compose up -d
```
```

## Task 3: Verify Kong Manager

Click on 'Kong Manager' at top of the screen 

![Kong Manager](../graphics/kong_manager_tab.png)

<!-- If you wish you can pop this out to a new tab.

Or click [here](http://{{ .STRIGO_RESOURCE_DNS }}:8002) -->

Please note, you may need to click the refresh button.

You'll notice you did not need to log into Kong Manager - that's because RBAC Authentication has not yet been enabled. 

You'll also notice the warning about the license - we will apply the licence next.
